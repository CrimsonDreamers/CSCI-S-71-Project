We started with a brainstorming for ideas and we decided of a vision for our project and product.
Our Miro board is separated in two where we have on top a Kanban board with all the things we have to produce for our assignment. On the right of the Kanban board we have all the board we used to continue working on tasks (Far vision, near vision, persona types and a detailed user persona. 

Everytime the team thought a task for the assigment was completed, the team was marking it with a emoji "check mark" to indicate to the PO that he will have to review the task and transfer it to done when he thinks the task has been completed.

At the bottom we have started working on the project with starting with a common understanding workshop to make sure we all had the same vision for our product and we started writing user stories, Definition of ready & acceptance criteria etc.
We did refined the user sories and added additional details (when needed) & acceptance criterias to each of them. We created an item list for our DOR and placed it near our PB for reference. Then we proceded with a poker planning session to estimate those user stories. Only developers were asked to estimate the backlog.

### Project Part 2
- Sprint planning: You have a forecast of how many story points your team can complete during the sprint. The forecast is documented in your README.
  - Forecast can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VDQO14WLbvyb7d7xZ2lXw-nEitjI2kIVgZPprM8kmAQ/edit?gid=24#gid=24), as well as on our [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK2OVZ-c=/).
  - For pessimistic forecast, 65 story points per sprint; for reasonable forecast, 85 story points per sprint; for optimistic forecast, 100 story points per sprint.
  - We've re-estimated and re-done our user stories as part of Sprint re-do on July 3rd, which means for our first Sprint we've decreased our forecast velocity.
- The rationale for your forecast is documented in your README.
  - Rationale for this forecast: Because we didn't have starting data for our first sprint planning. We started by dividing the Product backlog total story points and we used the ranged project burndown because we thought it was more representative of the reality that can happened during a sprint. A lower amount of points and a very pessimistic scenario was envisioned in case of a catastrophe that would make it almost impossible to meet to work on our project. A realistic forecast is that we will probably do a little better than what we are confident to accomplish this sprint. And we went with a slightly more optimistic scenario if everything works on the first try and that we don't get any impediment that we didn't foresee. 85 was our basic number we came up during sprint planning based on how the developers feels that they can accomplish this sprint and that we will gather data and feedback to inspect and adapt in the next sprint.
- You pulled stories into your sprint backlog. You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast. Developers participated in this activity (and in your project README, you made a statement or provided evidence that only Developers participated in this activity). (1 point for each item)
  - See [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK2OVZ-c=/), stories are pulled from top of product backlog to sprint backlog.
  - Aggregated size of story is 20, while the forecast for this sprint is 20.
  - Only developers participated in this activity.
- All of the stories in your sprint backlog are the right size: the size of each backlog item is less than half your forecast velocity for the sprint. If you noticed PBIs that are too large to get done in a sprint, you refined them by splitting them into smaller stories and estimating the smaller stories.
  - Size of the largest item is 40, which is less than half of 85 (our usual forecast velocity for the sprint). For the first Sprint though, we've decreased our velocity to 20.
- You decomposed user stories into developer tasks (1 point). The tasks are clearly listed in your sprint backlog (1 point).
  - Decomposed our first user story (which is the only one we are doing) into multiple developer tasks.
  - The tasks are listed alongside the user story in the sprint backlog.
- Your sprint backlog, including both the user stories and developer tasks, is represented in a kanban board (1 point). The URL of the kanban board is documented in your README (1 point). Course staff can view the kanban board (1 point).
  - The sprint backlog kanban board is seen on our [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK2OVZ-c=/).
- You have a sprint burndown chart. On the x-axis, you display time markers in units of 1 day. On the y-axis, you display story points remaining to get done. There is a linear curve descending from left to right; the leftmost point of the curve is number of story points in your sprint at sprint day 1; the rightmost point is 0 story points remaining on the last day of the sprint. The burndown chart, or the URL of the burndown chart, is document in your README. Course staff can view the burndown chart. (1 point for each sentence you complete)
  - The sprint burndown chart can be see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VDQO14WLbvyb7d7xZ2lXw-nEitjI2kIVgZPprM8kmAQ/edit?gid=1873440250#gid=1873440250).
  - The x-axis is each day until end of this sprint.
  - The y-axis is story points to be done.
  - There is a linear curve for predicted progress, and a linear curve for actual progress, descending down from left to right.
  - The leftmost point of the curve is the number of story points we have allocated for this sprint at day 1.
  - The rightmost point is zero story points at the last day.
  - The chart is available to everyone with the link.
- You have conducted multiple Daily Scrums. You document evidence of at least one daily scrum in your README.

/ 1 pts
  - We forecast 60 story points we can complete during this sprint.
  - Here is link to our [Sprint burndown.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VDQO14WLbvyb7d7xZ2lXw-nEitjI2kIVgZPprM8kmAQ/edit?gid=2014937941#gid=2014937941)

- The rationale for your forecast is documented in your README.
/ 1 pts
  - Based on empirical evidence, we've finished 20 story points in one day in the last sprint. We have three full days for the new sprint, so we forecast a total of 60 story points we can finish in the new sprint. See [Miro board.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK1Rl7ig=/)
- You pulled stories into your sprint backlog. You pulled stories from the top of your product backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed your forecast.

  - We pulled stories into our sprint backlog. See [Miro board.](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVK1Rl7ig=/)
  - The stories are from the top of the product backlog.
  - The aggregate size of the stories is 58, while the forecast of the capacity is 60.
  - Only developers participated in this activity (Carl, Teddy, Xianglong).

We started with a brainstorming for ideas and we decided of a vision for our project and product.
Our Miro board is separated in two where we have on top a Kanban board with all the things we have to produce for our assignment. On the right of the Kanban board we have all the board we used to continue working on tasks (Far vision, near vision, persona types and a detailed user persona. 

Everytime the team thought a task for the assigment was completed, the team was marking it with a emoji "check mark" to indicate to the PO that he will have to review the task and transfer it to done when he thinks the task has been completed.

At the bottom we have started working on the project with starting with a coomon understanding workshop to make sure we all had the same vision for our product and we started writing user stories, Definition of ready & acceptance criteria etc.
We did refined the user sories and added additional details (when needed) & acceptance criterias to each of them. Then we proceded with a poker planning session to estimate those user stories. Only developers were asked to estimate the backlog.
